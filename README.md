## 🏗️ Core Architecture

The application's strength lies in its **two-stage "Constrained Agent" architecture with structured output**. Instead of giving a powerful AI agent free access to the entire database (which is slow and error-prone), we intelligently break the problem into two focused steps with type-safe guarantees:

graph TD
    A[User Input: Who won in 2018?] --> B{Stage 1: Table Selector<br/>with Pydantic Validation}

    end

    style F fill:#F3E5F5,stroke:#7B1FA2,stroke-width:2px
```

### 🎯 Stage 1: The Database Router (Table Selector) with Structured Output

A lightweight, specialized LLM call with **Pydantic validation** that acts as an intelligent "database router."

**Input:**
- User's question
- Conversation history
- High-level table dictionary (`table_dictionary.csv`)

**Process:**
1. Analyzes user intent with explicit pattern matching rules
2. Identifies the **minimal set of tables** required
3. Returns **structured output** (guaranteed format via Pydantic)
4. **Safety check** automatically adds missing tables (e.g., FantasyOwners_LLM for "who" questions)

**Output (Structured):**
```python
TableSelection(
    tables=["FantasySeasons_LLM", "FantasyOwners_LLM"],
    reasoning="User asked WHO won, need owners for names and seasons for championship data"
)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Zero parsing errors (guaranteed format)
- ✅ Get reasoning for free (helps debugging)
- ✅ Type-safe with validation
- ✅ Fallback safety checks prevent missing tables

> **Why This Matters:** Structured output eliminates an entire class of parsing bugs. The combination of explicit prompts, Pydantic validation, and safety checks ensures the agent always has the tables it needs.

### 🤖 Stage 2: The Constrained SQL Agent

The main "worker" agent operating under strict, dynamically-generated constraints with enhanced error handling.

**Dynamic Context Loading:**
- Agent is initialized fresh for each query
- Receives only the detailed schema for Stage 1's selected tables
- Schema loaded from rich `data_dictionary.csv` with semantic context
- Clear formatting prevents ambiguity

**Methodical Reasoning (ReAct Framework):**
1. **Think:** Formulate approach to the problem
2. **Act:** Execute SQL query or other action
3. **Observe:** Analyze results
4. **Repeat:** Continue until question is answered

**Self-Correction Capabilities:**
- Analyzes database error messages
- Automatically corrects faulty SQL queries
- **Loop prevention:** Won't repeat the same failed query
- **Timeout protection:** 30-second limit, 8 max iterations
- Ensures high system resilience

## 🔄 How It Works: Step-by-Step Example

Let's trace through a complete query: **"Who won the championship in 2018?"**

### 1. 🚪 Simple Router Check
```
Input: "Who won the championship in 2018?"
Result: Not a simple greeting → Continue to Table Selector
```

### 2. 🎯 Table Selector (Stage 1) with Structured Output
```
Input: User question + table descriptions
LLM Processing with Pydantic:
  - "who" implies a person's name → need FantasyOwners_LLM table
  - "championship in 2018" → need FantasySeasons_LLM table
  
Structured Output:
  TableSelection(
    tables=['FantasySeasons_LLM', 'FantasyOwners_LLM'],
    reasoning='User asked WHO won, need owners for names and seasons for championship'
  )

Safety Check:
  - Detected "who" keyword ✓
  - FantasyOwners_LLM present ✓
  - No additional tables needed ✓
```

### 3. 📋 Schema Injection
```
Process: Read data_dictionary.csv
Result: Build detailed, well-formatted schema string for the 2 selected tables
======================================================================
DATABASE SCHEMA - AVAILABLE TABLES AND COLUMNS
======================================================================
📊 Table: FantasySeasons_LLM
  • season_id: Unique identifier for the season (corresponds to year)
  • champion_owner_id: ID of the championship winner
  
📊 Table: FantasyOwners_LLM
  • owner_id: Unique identifier for each owner
  • owner_name: Full name of the fantasy league owner
======================================================================
```

### 4. 🤖 Constrained Agent (Stage 2)
```
Agent receives focused schema and begins ReAct process:

💭 Thought 1: "I need to find the winner's name. I can get the champion_owner_id 
   from FantasySeasons_LLM where season_id is 2018, then JOIN with FantasyOwners_LLM 
   to get the name."

🔧 Action: sql_db_query
   Query: SELECT T2.owner_name 
          FROM FantasySeasons_LLM AS T1 
          JOIN FantasyOwners_LLM AS T2 ON T1.champion_owner_id = T2.owner_id 
          WHERE T1.season_id = 2018

👀 Observation: [('Jake',)]

💭 Thought 2: "Perfect! I have the result 'Jake'. This directly answers the user's question."

✅ Final Answer: Jake won the championship in 2018.
```

### 5. 🧠 Memory Update
```
Process: Save user question and AI answer to conversation memory
Result: Context available for future follow-up questions
Context Counter: Updates sidebar with current message count
```
